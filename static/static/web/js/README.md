# Important note to the future developers

Some JavaScript files in this folder were automatically generated with CoffeeScript.

Please **DO NOT EDIT `.js` files** while there are `.coffee` files with the same names exist!

Edit `.coffee` file instead and then generate `.js` file with coffeescript's compiler:

    coffee -c static/static/web/js/*.coffee

CoffeeScript syntax just seems looking better than JS and better structured.
